Some effects, like Outline or SelectiveBloom can select specific objects. To
manage this in a declarative scene with just references can be messy, especially
when things have to be grouped. These two components take care of it:

```jsx
<Selection
  children: JSX.Element | JSX.Element[]
  enabled?: boolean
>

<Select
  children: JSX.Element | JSX.Element[]
  enabled?: boolean
>
```

You wrap everything into a selection, this one holds all the selections. Now you
can individually select objects or groups. Effects that support selections (for
instance `Outline`) will acknowledge it.

```jsx
<Selection>
  <EffectComposer autoclear={false}>
    <Outline blur edgeStrength={100} />
  </EffectComposer>
  <Select enabled>
    <mesh />
  </Select>
</Selection>
```

Selection can be nested and group multiple object, higher up selection take
precence over lower ones. The following for instance will select everything.
Remove the outmost `enabled` and only the two mesh group is selected. You can
flip the selections or bind them to interactions and state.

```jsx
<Select enabled>
  <Select enabled>
    <mesh />
    <mesh />
  </Select>
  <Select>
    <mesh />
  </Select>
</Select>
```
